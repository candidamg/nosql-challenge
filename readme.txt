EAT SAFE,LOVE

On this challenge I used MongoDB database program to make an exploratory analysis of the UK Food Standars Agency's food hygiene rating with Python. For this, the magazine, "Eat safe, Love", asked to analyze the data in order to help their journalists. 

The analysis includes the rating establishments with lowest and highest hygiene score. Queries were done by finding the business type, adding a new restaurant and then filtering by restaurant name. Additionally, the latitue and longitude of the data was updated from object to double.

The json file named 'establishments' can be found in the Resources folder. This file was used for both the analysis and the setup for this challenge.
